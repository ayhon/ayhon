### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In the internet I'm known as `ayhon`. I'm a CompSci and Math student, currently finishing my bachelor**s** _(Yes, plural)_.

What are some interesting repos to look at? Well, I would start with the ones pinned bellow.

You can find my personal website [here](https://ayhon.eu). I sometimes post about stuff there. 

To contact me, reach out through my socials in the side bar.

Have a nice day!
